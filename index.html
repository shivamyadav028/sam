            <h2>Cause of Neglect</h2>
            <p>Despite its rich cultural heritage, Uttarakhand faces neglect due to several factors. Inadequate infrastructure and poor connectivity hinder tourism and preservation efforts. Limited funding and government focus on more developed regions result in insufficient maintenance of monuments and museums. Additionally, the state's challenging terrain complicates conservation activities. The lack of awareness and promotion further exacerbates the issue, causing a decline in local traditions and languages. Urbanization and migration also contribute to the erosion of cultural practices. Addressing these challenges requires concerted efforts in improving infrastructure, increasing funding, and promoting Uttarakhandâ€™s unique heritage both locally and globally.</p>

            <h2>Science behind the construction of the monument</h2>
            <p>The construction of monuments integrates scientific disciplines like material science, structural engineering, and geometry. Builders utilize durable materials such as stone and metal, employing structural techniques such as arches and load distribution to ensure stability against natural forces. Precision in geometric design and mathematical calculations ensures aesthetic balance and structural integrity. Some monuments incorporate astronomical alignments, reflecting ancient knowledge of celestial movements. Advanced construction techniques like lever systems and precise acoustics further enhance their functionality and cultural significance. These scientific principles, coupled with artistic craftsmanship, contribute to the enduring legacy and architectural marvels of monuments worldwide.</p>
